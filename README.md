## Introduction

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. This repository includes my personal solutions to these problems, implemented in Python. Each script corresponds to a specific problem, with filenames indicating the problem number (e.g., `ex1.py` for Problem 1).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yuvalc2006/project_euler.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd project_euler
   ```

3. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On Unix or MacOS:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run a specific solution, execute the corresponding Python script. For example, to run the solution for Problem 1:

```bash
python ex1.py
```

Each script is designed to output the solution to its respective problem when run.

## Features

- Solutions to multiple Project Euler problems.
- Clear and concise Python implementations.
- Organized by problem number for easy navigation.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x

Additional dependencies, if any, are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
